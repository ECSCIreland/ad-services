<h2>Analyze</h2>
<p>
    We are strongly committed to fighting the <strong>digital dark age</strong>. Most file formats
    used by previous generations are now unreadable due to a lack of historical information and 
    working hardware from the past. After realizing that the blind race to innovation nearly
    destroyed the human race, we believe that the key to a sustainable future is to learn from past 
    mistakes and avoid history repeating itself. You can use this page to analyze the content of old
    archive files you may find around. Notice that <strong>we value your privacy</strong>, so we do 
    not access files uploaded on this page. This is possible thanks to the integration of ancient 
    and modern technologies that enable the archive analysis process <strong>entirely in your 
    browser</strong>. Please recycle your archives if you are happy to share them with us.
