<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    As shocking as it may sound, walking barefoot on grass was common in the past. Looking around 
    now, all we can see are mountains made of junk. Former generations romanticized rainy days and 
    the smell of wet ground in the air after a storm. Those generations also made it impossible for
    us to live the same experiences. Rain is acid, and the land is buried under tens of meters of 
    rubbish. We could not stand this <em>new norm</em> anymore. We hated being in constant danger 
    because of hazardous materials lying around. And we hated being unable to produce medical 
    equipment to cure our beloved ones due to the lack of natural resources on the Planet. But
    hatred alone brings further destruction, turning people blind and preventing them from 
    realizing the obvious. Indeed, the solution coincided with the problem. All the electronic 
    junk assembled over the centuries is an open-pit mine that we can use for good.
